TODO notepad
============
- fix constants
- remove layer of TARGET-... functions in llvm.lisp? should be the same as functions in runtime.lisp?
- implement llvm value/type container that can handle both lisp & llvm values and treat corresponding values transparently as equal
- implement debugging functionality for llvm abstraction layer (dump values & types etc.)



OLD (2014-07-04)
================
- remove secd code generation (not necessary for llvm-ir generation)
- insert pass to generate cfgraph - most probably _before_ analyze-pass?
- work out how to generate "merge" basic block after if-clause

- secd generation for if is not correct (missing RET opcode in the end of then- & else-clauses?)
  => expressions after "if" (in a sequence) don't get evaluated
