TODO notepad
============

- remove secd code generation (not necessary for llvm-ir generation)
- insert pass to generate cfgraph - most probably _before_ analyze-pass?
- work out how to generate "merge" basic block after if-clause

- secd generation for if is not correct (missing RET opcode in the end of then- & else-clauses?)
  => expressions after "if" (in a sequence) don't get evaluated
